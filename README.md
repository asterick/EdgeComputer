EdgeComputer
============

This is the working folder for my 5v computer, with a custom, microcoded 
CPU using GALs and 74xx series chips.  The currently, this is just a pet
project with no real goal other than to create a computer from random 
parts.

I'm take a very software first approach to this, so the approach is very
emulator / soft processor driven.

Current TODO list
